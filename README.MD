# AI in Software Engineering 💻🤖

This project is part of the Week 4 assignment for the AI in Software Engineering course. It explores how Artificial Intelligence can be used to improve and automate various aspects of software development.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand and apply AI tools in software engineering
- Use AI-powered code generation (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
- Automate testing using Selenium IDE
- Apply predictive analytics using the Breast Cancer dataset
- Reflect on ethical AI use in software development

---

## 🧠 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

- Explained the role of tools like GitHub Copilot in reducing dev time
- Compared supervised vs. unsupervised learning in bug detection
- Analyzed bias in AI personalization
- Studied AIOps in improving software deployment

---

## 🛠️ Part 2: Practical Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: AI Code Completion
- Used GitHub Copilot to generate a function that sorts dictionaries
- Compared Copilot vs. manual implementation

### 🔹 Task 2: Automated Testing
- Created a Selenium test for login functionality (valid & invalid inputs)
- Captured success/failure screenshots
- Reflected on benefits of AI-enhanced testing

### 🔹 Task 3: Predictive Analytics
- Used Kaggle Breast Cancer dataset
- Preprocessed and trained a Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluated using accuracy and F1-score
